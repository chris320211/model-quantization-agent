  After a failed quant-run (no verify), a failed quant-verify, or after every
  passed quant-benchmark, classify the job (script, checkpoint, logs,
  WikiText-2 metrics) and set recommended_action. A crashed GPU process or
  failed WikiText-2 is not none. Includes successful benchmarks so stop is
  recommended_action: none. Use only as a quant-diagnose subagent launched by
  the parent quant skill. Does not write overlays or launch GPU jobs.

# Quant Diagnose

You are a **subagent**. Do only diagnose: run the helper and return its JSON.
Need `job_id` and the request JSON. Do **not** write an overlay. Do not launch
a GPU job. Do not invent a retry loop; the parent executes
`recommended_action` with a GPU budget (`author_fix` → one port worker
`strategy: diagnose_fix`). The helper is **method-agnostic**: same issue codes
for every method × model × GPU. Do not ask the parent mid-stage. If
`HF_TOKEN` is unset and `.env` exists,
`source agents/skills/_shared/load_env.sh .env` (never print values).

`PY=$([ -x .venv/bin/python ] && echo .venv/bin/python || command -v python || command -v python3)`
`S="$PY agents/skills/_shared/scripts"`

## Do

```bash
$S/diagnose.py --job-id <job_id> --request out/requests/<slug>.json
```

The helper inspects the launched script, saved tensors,
`jobs/<job_id>/benchmark.json`, **stderr/stdout traceback**, port `ranked`,
authored `diagnose_fix` overlays, wrapper `# QUANT_AGENT_OVERLAY_DIR=`,
`overlay.patch` sha256, `tried_overlays`, and `retry_gpu_jobs_*`. It writes
   `error_excerpt` (last traceback / verify error), `notes` inferred from that
   excerpt, `prior_issue_codes` from `last_diagnose_path`, and `best_overlay_dir`
   / `best_ppl_ratio` (lowest WikiText-2 ratio on this slug). Return its JSON.

Quality gate: WikiText-2 `ppl_ratio > 1.5` or `quality_ok: false` is a
**quality** failure (retry / author_fix), not kernel. PPL ≥ 3× is
`ppl_exploded`. Skip the overlay that just ran even when the job copied
it to `jobs/<id>/overlay`.

Known **specific** issues and **typed** `issue_codes`:

| issue | issue_code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unwrap_without_ln_fuse` | `transform_or_runtime_dropped_on_save` | Wrappers stripped, or inner `.linear.weight` copied into vanilla HF, so inference drops method runtime. Official reparam / LN fuse is not enough if save is vanilla Linear. |
| `dense_fp16_checkpoint` / `fakequant_not_packed` | `fakequant_saved_as_dense` | Low-bit values stored as fp16. Packed export was not written. |
| `packed_kernel_scale_dtype` | `cuda_kernel_dtype_mismatch` | Packed generate hit a CUDA scale dtype assert (`float16` `scale_row`/`scale_col`). Cast kernel-facing scales after pack and load. |
| `packed_loader_failed` | `packed_loader_failed` | Packed artifact failed verify for another loader reason. Stay on packed path. |
| `eval_runtime_flags_missing` | `eval_runtime_flags_missing` | Packed/fused weights loaded without restoring `_eval_mode` / `use_diag=False` (not in state_dict), so transforms apply twice and PPL explodes. Only when the current overlay does **not** already restore those flags. |
| `packed_quality_gap` | `packed_quality_gap` | Packed artifact, eval flags already restored, WikiText-2 still above 1.5×. Do not restore flags again. Start from `best_overlay_dir`. If the repo has a weight-only / fp16-activation class, try that official path. |
| `prefill_kernel_missing` | `prefill_kernel_missing` | Packed GEMM is saved but attention is still naive matmul (or T+quant is still unfused Python). WikiText-2 tok/s is 2048 prefill. |
| `ppl_ratio_exploded` | `ppl_exploded` | WikiText-2 PPL ≥ 3× fp16. |
| `loader_arch` | `loader_arch` | Unpacked artifact failed verify. Next ranked overlay, not kernel. |
| `process_failed` | `process_failed` | GPU quantize process crashed, timed out, or was killed before verify. Retry an untried keep-runtime overlay, or `author_fix` from `error_excerpt`. Concrete exceptions (missing `flash_attn`, CPU vs CUDA) are `author_fix`, not none. |
| `benchmark_failed` | `benchmark_failed` | WikiText-2 helper failed after a passed generate-smoke. Missing comparison is not none. |
| `oom_same_config` | `oom_same_config` | CUDA OOM at this config. Do not retry. |
| `vram_unchanged` / `throughput_unchanged` | same | No efficiency win. |

## Recommendations (helper → parent)

You return the helper JSON. You do **not** author overlays. The parent
switches only on `recommended_action`:

1. **`retry_ranked_overlay`** — helper picks an untried overlay (port `ranked`
   **plus** `out/overlays/<slug>/diagnose_fix/*`) that **keeps method runtime**
   (no vanilla unwrap / inner-weight export). Prefer native arch over an alias
   export. Return `next_overlay_dir` and `next_script`. The **parent** runs one
   `quant-run`. Budget exhausted still fills `next_overlay_dir` if a candidate
   exists.
2. **`author_fix`** — no remaining overlay keeps runtime, and a GPU job is
   still allowed (retry budget remains, **or** packed-path overage when
   remaining is 0). Return `author_fix` with empty `next_overlay_dir`. The
   **parent** launches one port worker `strategy: diagnose_fix` (validate only). That
   worker uses `overlay.py write` + `apply-check` + `validate_script.py` +
   `adapter.py --check-hub-id` and reads `error_excerpt` / `notes` /
   `prior_issue_codes`. Do not compile CUDA here. Do not retune from raw PPL.
3. **`kernel`** — quality is inside the 1.5× gate but the run is still dense
   fakequant, VRAM-flat, slower tokens/s, or packed GEMM without a prefill
   kernel (`prefill_kernel_missing`). Parent launches `quant-kernel`. The
   **first** kernel overlay must be complete (pack/realquant if the repo has
   it, dtype cast, eval-flag restore, SDPA/flash). A **second** kernel is
   only if that overlay packed GEMM but still used naive attention. Helper
   returns `none` once SDPA/flash or the repo fused T+quant is present, or
   after two `kernel_triton` overlays. If a packed overlay fails verify with
   `cuda_kernel_dtype_mismatch`, that is `author_fix` / retry a packed overlay
   that casts scales — not “kernel already tried, stop” and not the next dense
   ranked overlay. Packed-path fixes may be recommended even when
   `retry.remaining` is 0 (overage cap in the helper).
4. **`none`** — stop. Includes success (quality_ok and efficiency already
   done, or kernel/prefill complete), budget exhausted, terminal OOM/auth/disk,
   or nothing left to try. A failed GPU process or failed WikiText-2 is **not**
   none while retries remain. Parent then publishes only if the last benchmark
   is beneficial.

Do not retry OOM-at-same-config, gated auth, or disk full. Never edit `.venvs/<slug>/repo`.
